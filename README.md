# Cosmregistry API
Using the power of [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) & [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui), Cosmregistry API will generate a `data.json` every hour (or however frequently you specify) and the json-server will pick up the changes to serve over it's REST API with a Swagger interface.
